# INDUCTION-PROGRAM @ GNDEC
# Day 1
## 30th July 2025

The first day of my college life started with devotional practice by seeking blessings from Waheguru ji. The Shabad Kirtan program held at college gurudwara sahib. Granthi singh ji did ARDAAS for our future journey and he also make us remember about the purpose with which we all have taken admission in GNDEC. 
The starting of the day was very soothing and whole atmosphere was quite peaceful.

The formal ceremony was held in the Auditorium. Dr. Harpreet Kaur mam(HoD-Applied Sciences) welcomed us with motivational message. 

Our Principal, Dr. Sehijpal Singh emphasized the college's strong academic reputation and encouraged us to avail many opportunities available in campus.

The Chief Guest, S. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, Ex-Cabinet Minister and Senior Trustee of Nankana Sahib Education Trust inspired us with his words on discipline, having purpose in life and importance of education.

After that, Teacher's showed us the Heat Engine Lab, Hydraulic Lab and Workshops area. They make us aware about the machinery and the work we have to do in workshops. Prof. JP Singh sir explained about the basics of engineering. He talked about each and every branch in brief and how they are interrelated to each other.

The day ends here. It was full of enthusiasm, inspiration, learning with new beginnings.

# Day 2
## 1st August 2025

The day started with full excitement in the students to learn new things. The program began in the Auditorium, welcoming our expert Dr. Priya Darshni mam. Her lecture was on the topic "Universal Human Values". The motive of the interaction was to make us realize our real and basic aspiration of life, that is to be happy and prosperous in continuity. She discussed about true goals of life and right path to achieve them. She also talked about the concerns or problems we face while achieving our goals. In a nutshell, the lecture was much needed for all the students as we are running towards the wrong path and not getting what we actually want.

The session taught us to:- 
     • Accept
     • Adjust
     • Have purpose in life

After this, Dr. Arvind Dhingra took the stage. He engaged in friendly banter with students. He told us about the various societies and clubs running in the College. He explained each of them briefly. Seven Boys and seven girls students were called at the stage and he played a game with them. The team boys won that & he gave chocolates to appreciate everyone.
     
Further on, English & Maths Profienciency Tests were conducted by senior students in the Workshop Seminar Hall. 

Here, the day ends experiencing new life.

# Day 3
## 4th August 2025

Another day, more motivation. 
The session was taken by Causmic Club in Auditorium. The team anchor, Ms. Taranpreet Kaur talked about their mission and vision that is - "To learn something from everything in its physical essence; the essence, which is equally enlightening and dark."
The team is quite active at social media platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, Google website etc. I personally, want to join and volunteer this team, taking their vision on the top. 

Our expert, Dr. Priya Darshni mam was back with her 2nd lecture on "Universal Human Values". Firstly, she took questions from students related to last lecture and explained very well. Moving on, she talked on few topics such as "Right understanding", "Process of self exploration", "Relationship", "Physical Facility", "Resolution of concerns", "Partial & Complete harmony in Self" and many more. The session was filled with great knowledge.

In break time, the members of FM Community Radio Station were visiting new students and took their reviews about the induction program and college. I also gave them my reviews and they posted the videos on their Instagram page.

After that we had an interactive lecture with Prof. Jaswant Singh Taur sir of Information Technology department. He asked three questions from everyone. That are:
1) Why we have chosen specific branch?
2) Why we have taken admission in GNDEC only?
3) What is our purpose of choosing that specific branch and college?

Some students answered him and everyone had their own reasons and thoughts.
His words taught us the main mantra of life - "Self-Belief is the foundation of success – when you believe in yourself, anything is possible."

Here we ended the day and see you in the next learning session.

# Day 4
## 5th August 2025

I started my day with little laziness.
But when I reached TCC Seminar Hall where Mr. Gautam Murria, our senior came to deliver lecture on "Motor Sports" all my listlessness dissappeared because his way of interaction was quite energetic.

Our last lecture was taken by expert Mrs. Shaffy Makkar on "Millets Super Food". It was a great session. Her information was very helpful and useful too. The main question was "Why should we shift our diet from cereal grain like wheat to coarse grain like millets (bajra, jawar, Raagi etc.)?"
She started from this main question only. She informed us about prons and cons of both millets and cereal grain food. She covered each & every millet precisely. We concluded that, "Millets are generally more nutritious, gluten-free, and better for blood sugar and sustainability than wheat. However, both can be part of a healthy diet when consumed mindfully and in variety".
At the end she also told us about various methods of cooking food & adding millets to diet. Eating by soaking millets is the best way to consume them as they provide accurate amount of fibre to our body.

That brings us to the end of a beautiful college day.

# Day 5
## 6th August 2025

"Every day of the program unfolded with fresh energy, offering new insights and opportunities to connect with our peers and mentors."

Our first lecture was with Dr. Parminder Singh(Dean-Student Welfare) in the Auditorium. He made us aware about the whole campus. He gave information regarding the facilities given to students like internet connectivity, dispensary, canteens, tuck shop, hostels, gurudwara sahib, sports ground and many other clubs/activities and societies. His presentation & way of explaining was very nice.

“The youth today are passionate about fitness, making the gym their second home.”
Expert Mr. Manpreet Singh came to encourage the young engineers on "Fitness". Personally, I loved the session very much as I have great interest in doing gym/physical activity. What I experienced in the session was that boys students were more active & curious to know about fitness, gym, steroids, whey proteins, cardio & strength training and myths. A small competition of push-ups for boys was conducted by him at the stage. All of them were very determined while participating. Sir covered each part related to fitness training. His way of interaction deeply touched my heart.

Going on, Team NCC (National Cadet Corps) took the stage. They told us about their mission and vision. Team head informed us about various camps and training sessions conducted in college or in other campuses. We got to know that NCC members are given opportunities of learning and practicing real time firing with weapons. Then, our respected Brigadier P.S Cheema sir arrived.
