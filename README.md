# Day 2
## 1st August 2025

The day started with full excitement in the students to learn new things. The program began in the Auditorium, welcoming our expert Dr. Priya Darshni mam. Her lecture was on the topic "Universal Human Values". The motive of the interaction was to make us realize our real and basic aspiration of life, that is to be happy and prosperous in continuity. She discussed about true goals of life and right path to achieve them. She also talked about the concerns or problems we face while achieving our goals. In a nutshell, the lecture was much needed for all the students as we are running towards the wrong path and not getting what we actually want.

The session taught us to:- 
     • Accept
     • Adjust
     • Have purpose in life

After this, Dr. Arvind Dhingra took the stage. He engaged in friendly banter with students. He told us about the various societies and clubs running in the College. He explained each of them briefly. Seven Boys and seven girls students were called at the stage and he played a game with them. The team boys won that & he gave chocolates to appreciate everyone.
     
Further on, English & Maths Profienciency Tests were conducted by senior students in the Workshop Seminar Hall. 

Here, the day ends experiencing new life.
