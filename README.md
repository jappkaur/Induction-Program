### Spiritual Welcome
The first day of my college life started with devotional practice by seeking blessings from Waheguru ji. The Shabad Kirtan program held at college gurudwara sahib. Granthi singh ji did ARDAAS for our future journey and he also make us remember about the purpose with which we all have taken admission in GNDEC. 
The starting of the day was very soothing and whole atmosphere was quite peaceful.

Then the program continued in Auditorium where Principal Dr. Sehajpal Singh sir, Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal mam(HOD - Applied Sciences), Dr. Randhir Singh sir, Faculty members of each branch and our seniors- The members of causmic club welcomed us. They motivated us with their valuable thoughts and experiences.
